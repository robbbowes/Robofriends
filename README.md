## A simple React app to practice using state, props, children, destructuring, api calls, and ES6+

# What I'd change:#
* Not much really, it was purely a little react app to gain experience and confidence using react.
* Maybe work on the css a bit more

# What I like:#
* Has reusable code that could be used for displaying projects in a larger app, e.g. portfolio
* Code is clean and reusable
* First time using tachyons - tiny css file size but quite a clean looking app
